### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Computer Science student, specializing in Systems Development and a technology enthusiast. I'm passionate about exploring the latest trends in software development, from web to cloud computing and machine learning.

As a developer, I enjoy working on open-source projects that allow me to collaborate with other developers and contribute to the community. I'm always eager to learn new skills and improve my coding abilities, and I believe that the best way to achieve this is by working on real-world projects and facing new challenges.
